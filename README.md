# credit-suisse-crypto-exercise

Simple crypto trading coding exercise for Credit Suisse implemented in Gradle and Kotlin.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

## Notes

Since the exercise was a bit generic, I had to make some assumptions during the implementation.
I added comments to the code regarding these assumptions. I tried to follow the YAGNI rule, avoiding unnecessary fluff that wasn't required by the exercise.
However, I also left a few comments suggesting alternative approaches.
